This is a collection of OSL shaders and stylized material studies created with Pixar's RenderMan during my coursework at SCAD, under the instruction of Professor Malcolm Kesson.

The goal was to explore the power of OSL in generating procedural textures, animated shaders, and unique visual effects for look development.

## File Overview

- Custom OSL code (see [`osl/`](./osl))
- Maya scene files demonstrating shader use
- Preview renders and one demo animation

## Tools Used

- **Pixar RenderMan**
- **Maya**
- **Cutter** (for OSL shader writing, create an HTML local website for project demo and review)
- **Open Shading Language (OSL)**

## Learning Outcomes

- Developed custom procedural shaders using OSL
- Gained experience translating math into visual output
- Explored stylized shading approaches without textures
- Practiced integrating shaders into Maya + RenderMan pipeline
