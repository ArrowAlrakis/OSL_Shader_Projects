This is a collection of OSL shaders and stylized material studies created with Pixar's RenderMan during my coursework at SCAD, under the instruction of Professor Malcolm Kesson.

The goal was to explore the power of OSL in generating procedural textures, animated shaders, and unique visual effects for look development.

## File Overview

- Custom OSL code (see [`osl/`](./osl))
- Maya scene files demonstrating shader use
- Preview renders and one demo animation

## Tools Used

- **Pixar RenderMan** – for high-quality rendering and shader evaluation
- **Autodesk Maya** – for scene assembly, shader testing, and animation
- **Cutter** – a custom local development tool used at SCAD, I use it to write an local HTML pages for project preview, demo, submission, and feedback
- **Open Shading Language (OSL)** – for writing procedural shaders

## Learning Outcomes

- Developed custom procedural shaders using OSL
- Gained experience translating math into visual output
- Explored stylized shading approaches without textures
- Practiced integrating shaders into Maya + RenderMan pipeline
